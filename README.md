# Course: Compiler Construction

Our first attempt at auditing select Computer Science courses.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è You can suggest what we should do next [here](https://github.com/csklub/next-course-suggestions)

## Motivation

Even if you are not a CS major, this will make you a better software engineer -- by understanding the things that make your code talk to the machine.

## Primary Course

- [Build a Modern Computer from First Principles: Nand to Tetris Part II (project-centered course) | Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/nand2tetris2) - _start by signing up here, choose the **Audit** option. You are also encouraged to pay if you can._


## Meeting Schedule

- Saturdays 7 - 8 AM EAT, if missed, Sundays 7 - 8 PM EAT.
- **Starts:** Jan 14, 2023
- **Ends:** April 29, 2023
- **Meeting Link:** shared on the mailing-list
- _Invite Only_ for now.

## Course Schedule

- This is self-paced, but our general agreed pace (for the slowest) should be 2 weeks to cover 1 week of [the Coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/nand2tetris2). So we will take 14 weeks for the 7 c/weeks.
